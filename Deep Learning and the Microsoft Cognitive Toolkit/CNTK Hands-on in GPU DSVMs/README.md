# CNTK and MNIST on a single GPU

The CNTK_103D_MNIST_ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork notebook is a good example of a convolutional network applied to the MNIST dataset. Here we'll show how it uses the GPU.

nvidia-smi is a tool to show the processes running on a GPU, its utilization, and other useful information. It is available at the command line. To get a terminal through JupyterHub, go to the JupyterHub overview page, click New in the top-right corner, and select Terminal. You will get a new window that is running a bash terminal. From here, run nvidia-smi. You can also run nvidia-smi on a loop with the -lms option. Start nvidia-smi in a loop, then run the 103D notebook. Watch how the GPU memory is allocated, then the GPU utilization increases as the notebook begins training.

## X2Go

The Ubuntu DSVM uses X2Go for connecting to a graphical desktop. Although you can do many things through Jupyter or the terminal, you will sometimes need to log in to the desktop to use IDEs or other graphical tools. To configure X2Go on your computer:
- Download [X2Go](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php) and install it.
- Launch X2Go.
- Create a new session with Session -> New Session.
- enter a Session Name, Host, and Login.
- Set the Session type to XFCE.
- Under the Input/Output tab, Uncheck Set display DPI. Make sure the resolution, under Display, is set to Custom: 800 width, 600 height.
- Under the Media tab, uncheck Enable sound support and Client side printing support.

Click OK. Your session will appear as a new session on the right-hand side. Click it, then enter your password to connect.

## TensorBoard

TensorBoard is a tool from Google to visualize deep neural networks and training progress in your browser. CNTK supports writing output in the TensorBoard format. Create a new TensorBoardProgressWriter and pass it to your learner:

        tensorboard_writer = TensorBoardProgressWriter(freq=10, log_dir='log', model=my_model)
        trainer = cntk.Trainer(--, --, --, tensorboard_writer)

and run your CNTK code.

To view the output, log in to the remote desktop on the DSVM via X2Go. Instructions for configuring this are provided above. You can then start TensorBoard by launching a terminal and entering:

        source /anaconda/bin/activate py35
        tensorboard --logdir=log

Start a browser and navigate to http://localhost:6006. View the training progress under Scalars and the network under Graphs.

## Docker

Docker is a way to ship an application as a lightweight container. It provides a method to package up an application and its dependencies, then have it run on any machine. You can read more about Docker at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/). On the DSVM, Docker makes it easy to try new frameworks without compiling, configuring, etc.

nvidia-docker is a thin wrapper around Docker to enable GPU access inside a running container. You need the driver in the container to match the one in the host, and you need the GPU device(s) to be exposed in the container. Nvidia-docker handles these for you.
  
An example is packaged on the Workshop DSVMs for you. To run it, at a Terminal:

        nvidia-docker run -it -v ~/CHAINER:/host chainer/chainer
        cd /host
        python MNIST_chainer.py

To run it on another DSVM, clone the repo, go to the CNTK Hands-on in GPU DSVMs folder, and run at a Terminal:

        python download_MNIST_chainer.py
        nvidia-docker run -it -v $PWD:/host chainer/chainer
        cd /host
        python MNIST_chainer.py

## NVIDIA DIGITS

NVIDIA DIGITS is a graphical system for rapidly training deep learning models. It simplifies common tasks like managing data, designing and training networks, and evaluating the results. DIGITS is available on the DSVM as a service.

To use DIGITS, connect to the DSVM via X2Go (see the instructions above). Once you're connected, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. If the server is not running, you can start it with this command at a terminal:

        sudo systemctl start digits

It will take about a minute for the server to start.

There are some great tutorials on DIGITS, including one on [MNIST](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md). We've included a script to download the dataset, download_MNIST_DIGITS.sh. It will put the data in ~/mnist.
